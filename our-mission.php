                <p class="animated-element slow margin-bottom-30">Most claims today are made irrationally with no evidence supporting them. Certain institutions give false information, and give false hope, while numbers do not. The Influx Analytics team hopes to bring forward information that is factually correct. In cases where there are data available, most of their analyses are not effective nor conclusive enough. Being straightforward is something we strive to be as we hope to help those who require effective analysis. No matter how positive or negative the outcome of the analysis is, we will provide you with the right information.
                </p>

                <h3 class="animated-element text-strong text-size-20 text-line-height-1 margin-bottom-20">What's our solution?</h3>
                <p class="animated-element slow margin-bottom-30">Influx Analytics aims to provide effective and comprehensive solutions towards global issues. We hope to provide in-depth research that provides insights on significant phenomena worldwide, bringing complex issues into a model that is easily understood. We also plan to use our resources to provide hands-on assistance to local organizations that require data organization and analysis. We will focus on innovative analysis as well as service to share new ideas with the world at large.
