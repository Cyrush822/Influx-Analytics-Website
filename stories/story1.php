How should schools, teachers, and students effectively transition to distance learning in the 21st century? In previous global crises such as World War II, students were forced to relocate or put school on hold for safety reasons. In this day and age, new technology has enabled e-learning, allowing teachers to stay connected with students from home. Fortunately, modern software provides data on the decisions that teachers make and on the subsequent results on student learning as a whole. This study aims to investigate and analyze the actions employed by expat teachers in Southeast Asia, examining factors such as locational preferences, expected income post-COVID-19, and academic subjects taught. </h3>

                        <h3 class="animated-element text-size-20 text-line-height-3 margin-bottom-20">In such tumultuous times, the question of whether teachers should leave or stay in a host country naturally comes up.  Expat teachers in five Southeast Asia countries (Indonesia, Thailand, Philippines, Vietnam, and Singapore) were asked if they intend to leave their current country, move to another country, or return to their home country to teach after the end of the pandemic. According to Figure 1, teachers’ decisions to return home to teach were the lowest. Specifically, the intention to leave the host country was highest in Indonesia and lowest in Vietnam. Upon a further look into what drives Southeast Asia expat teachers’ intentions to move to another country to teach (Figure 2), a combination of an intention to return to their home country to teach along with their expected income after COVID-19 has the highest predictive strength (55%) on this target. Interestingly, the value of Intend_new_country is unusually low when the values of Income_after are 6 and 7, implying that teachers are less likely to leave if they expect a high salary. Indeed, home and money are understandably key priorities in this dire time. </h3>

                      <h3 class="animated-element text-size-20 text-line-height-3 margin-bottom-20">Given the significance of money, what do expat teachers in Southeast Asia expect to make after COVID-19? Could it possibly be related to the subject matter being taught? Through IBM’s Cognos Analytics, this study reveals that a combination of teacher income before COVID-19 and the subjects they teach has the highest predictive strength (83%) on this target (Figure 3). Specifically, according to Figure 4, it appears that teachers who teach STEM-related subjects and social science-related subjects are most optimistic. At the same time, there are three combinations each with a predictive strength of 80% on this target: the income before COVID-19 and the intent to return to their home country to teach; the income before COVID-19 and the amount of time they have been teaching at their current country; the income before COVID-19 and if they feel connected to and encouraged by expat communities.</h3>

Through Cognos Analytics, this study reveals that the predictive strength of this combination is only a mere 32%. Therefore, a combination of the type of school with the subject taught has little correlation with the expected salary after this pandemic. Also, an interesting observation is that the income teachers made before and during the pandemic did not affect their expected salaries after COVID-19 as significantly as other factors like subjects taught - their correlation values being 77% and 59% respectively.</h3>
                        <h3 class="animated-element text-size-20 text-line-height-3 margin-bottom-60">Indeed, the relocation of teachers and subsequent expected income can be attributed to a variety of factors including country of origin, current income and subject matters taught. With the development of COVID-19 and its drastic effects on global society, education in this time period will continue to change until a status quo is met post-pandemic. Through this pandemic, teachers must seize the opportunity to learn more about how to effectively adapt to the new digital-oriented society.</h3>
