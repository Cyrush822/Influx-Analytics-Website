No one, not even experts, expected the number of cases to be so drastically high; even now, the number of global cases is still on the rise. The scale of this global pandemic has shocked the world, but what are individual countries doing to prevent their case numbers from increasing? Schools, supermarkets, restaurants, and gyms are all shut down - or at least they should be. While certain institutions lie, give false information, and give false hope, numbers do not. Every single second, new cases are reported. On that account, this study observes how the national decisions made by 211 countries are impacted by numerous factors such as COVID-19. Specifically, it analyzes and pinpoints the key factors governments are considering when operating schools during the coronavirus. How does a government decide on if their educational institutions should be open or closed? Is it even safe? Keep reading, and find out.

IBM’s Cognos Analytics reveals that there is only one combination: the stringency index, the COVID death rate, the total deaths, the population, and population density. Shockingly, the predictive strength on this target is 21% (Figure 1). This means that for some reason, countries aren’t making decisions based on the danger level of COVID-19. Unfortunately, this jeopardizes students’ wellbeing, as seen by the recent surge in COVID-19 cases among students in the United States. Specifically, when the stringency index is at least 75.93, Cognos predicts that 95% are closed on a national level, 4% on a localized level, and less than 1% are open. At the same time, Cognos predicts that 77% of schools will be open if the stringency index is between 33.33 and 61.11, if the total deaths per million is at least 1.553, if the COVID death rate is less than 128.3, and if the population density is less than 23.89. In essence, changes in these individual factors specifically are what determine government decisions on school closure.

                      <h3 class="animated-element text-size-20 text-line-height-3 margin-bottom-20">Digging deeper into the reopening of schools, Cognos Analytics reveals that the decision to reopen each level (pre-primary, primary, lower-primary, and upper-primary) is highly dependent on the reopening of other levels and the technology used to conduct distance learning. For instance, a combination (Figure 2) of the opening of primary schools and the usage of radio as a distance education strategy for lower secondary schools has the greatest predictive strength (96%) on the reopening of pre-primary schools. At the same time, a combination (Figure 3) of the opening of primary schools and the usage of online learning platforms as a distance education strategy for primary schools has the greatest predictive strength (94%) on the reopening of lower secondary schools. The analysis indicates that most governments don’t want to reopen a specific level alone and that they prioritize the availability of tools for distance learning.
